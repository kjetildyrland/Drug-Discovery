Drug Discovery project with machine learning and neural networks

## Backround
The development of new drugs takes between 15-20 years of development and costs an average of 4 billion US dollars. Modern drug discovery and development usually follows a set of systematic procedures. For many years machine learning has played a role in drug discovery. In recent years modern machine learning techniques have been applied to all stages, from initial target discovery and compound screening to the analysis of pathology data during clinical development.
